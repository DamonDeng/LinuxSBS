Copy Linux step by step.

In order to learn Linux kernel, I decided to copy Linux source code step by step. And try to build and run it at each step, so that I can understand each part of Linux kernel.

It is 0.0.1 version

#--------0.0.1
Just copied first sector of header.S in arch/x86/boot.
Make it be able to boot from floppy disk and display some message.
